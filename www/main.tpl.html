<div class="lyrics">
  <br>I am a scientist - I seek to understand me
  <br>All of my impurities and evils yet unknown
  <br>I am a journalist - I write to you to show you
  <br>I am an incurable and nothing else behaves like me
  <br>
  <br>And I know what's right
  <br>But I'm losing sight of the clues
  <br>For which I search and choose to abuse
  <br>To just unlock my mind
  <br>Yeah just unlock my mind
  <br>
  <br>I am a pharmacist - prescriptions I will fill you
  <br>Potions pills and medicines to ease your painful lives
  <br>I am a lost soul, I shoot myself with rock &amp; roll
  <br>The hole I dig is bottomless but nothing else can set me free
  <br>
  <br>And I know what's right
  <br>But I'm losing sight of the clues
  <br>For which I search and choose to abuse
  <br>To just unlock my mind
  <br>Yeah just unlock my mind
  <br>
  <br>I am a scientist - I seek to understand me
  <br>I am an incurable and nothing else behaves like me
  <br>
  <br>Everything is right
  <br>Everything works out right
  <br>Everything fades from sight
  <br>Because that's alright with me
